## 📖 Description

This Travel Guide app helps users browse a list of travel destinations, see popular activities, and read/write reviews. It's built using Node.js and Express on the backend, EJS for templating, and uses local in-memory data (in JSON files or arrays) to simulate a database.

Users can:
- View a list of destinations
- See detailed info, activities, and reviews for each destination
- Add, edit, and delete reviews
- Filter reviews by rating

This project is perfect for learning full-stack basics: routing, CRUD operations, middleware, and templating.
